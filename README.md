# TFTPclient

## Disclaimer
This is not full TFTP Client and it's not done yet.
This program does not have a lot of functions implemented yet.

## How?
I used UNIX Sockets with standard C libraries. Program asks you to enter file that you want from server. After transfer. Program will print you how much data he recieves from server.
